<h1> 
<em>Still I Rise</em><br/>
Maya Angelou
</h1>

<p class="oops">
<h2>You may write me down in history</h2><br/>
With your bitter, twisted lies,<br/>
You may tread me in the very dirt<br/>
But still, like dust, <em>I'll rise</em>.<br/>
</p>

<p class="one">
<h3>Does my sassiness upset you?</h3><br/>
Why are you beset with gloom?<br/>
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br/>
Pumping in my living room.<br/>
</p>

<p class="two">
<h3>Just like moons and like suns,</h3><br/>
With the certainty of tides,<br/>
Just like hopes springing high,<br/>
Still <em>I'll rise</em>.<br/>
</p>

<p class="three">
<h4>Did you want to see me broken?</h4><br/> 
Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br/> 
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br/>
Weakened by my soulful cries.<br/>
</p>

<p class="four">
<h5>Does my haughtiness offend you?</h5><br/> 
Don't you take it awful hard<br/>
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br/>
Diggin' in my own back yard.<br/>
</p>

<p class="five">
<h6>You may shoot me with your words,</h6><br/>
You may cut me with your eyes,<br/>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br/>
But still, like air, <em>I'll rise.</em><br/>
</p>

<p class="six">
<h2>Does my sexiness upset you?</h2><br/> 
Does it come as a surprise<br/>
That I dance like I've got diamonds<br/>
At the meeting of my thighs?<br/> 
</p>

<p class="seven"
<br>Out of the huts of history's shame<br/>
<strong><em>I rise</em></strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="eight">
Up from a past that's rooted in pain<br/>
<strong><em>I rise</em></strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="nine">
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br/>
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br/>
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br/>
</p>

<p class="ten">
<strong><em>I rise</em></strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="eleven">
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear<br/>
</p>

<p class="twelve">
<strong><em>I rise</em></strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="thirteen">
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br/>
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br/>

<p class="fourteen">
<strong><em>I rise</em></strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="fifteen">
<strong><em>I rise</em></strong><br/>
</p>


<p class="sixteen">
		<br><strong><em>I rise.</em></strong><br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>

</p>
