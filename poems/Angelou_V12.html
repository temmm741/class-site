<h1> 
Still I Rise<br/>
Maya Angelou
</h1>

<p class="oops">
You may write me down in history<br/>
With your bitter, twisted <strong>lies</strong>,<br/>
You may tread me in the very dirt<br/>
But still, like dust, I'll <strong>rise</strong>.<br/>
</p>

<p class="one">
Does my sassiness upset you?<br/>
Why are you beset with <strong>gloom?</strong><br/>
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br/>
Pumping in my living <strong>room</strong>.<br/>
</p>

<p class="two">
Just like moons and like suns,<br/>
With the certainty of tides,<br/>
Just like hopes springing high,<br/>
Still I'll rise.<br/>
</p>

<p class="three">
Did you want to see me broken?<br/> 
Bowed head and lowered <strong>eyes?</strong><br/> 
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br/>
Weakened by my soulful <strong>cries.</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="four">
Does my haughtiness offend you?<br/> 
Don't you take it awful <strong>hard</strong><br/>
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br/>
Diggin' in my own back <strong>yard.</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="five">
You may shoot me with your words,<br/>
You may cut me with your <strong>eyes,</strong><br/>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br/>
But still, like air, I'll <strong>rise.</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="six">
Does my sexiness upset you?<br/> 
Does it come as a <strong>surprise</strong><br/>
That I dance like I've got diamonds<br/>
At the meeting of my <strong>thighs?</strong><br/> 
</p>

<p class="seven"
<br>Out of the huts of history's shame<br/>
I rise<br/>
</p>

<p class="eight">
Up from a past that's rooted in pain<br/>
I rise<br/>
</p>

<p class="nine">
I'm a black ocean, leaping and <strong>wide</strong>,<br/>
Welling and swelling I bear in the <strong>tide</strong>.<br/>
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br/>
</p>

<p class="ten">
I rise<br/>
</p>

<p class="eleven">
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear<br/>
</p>

<p class="twelve">
I rise<br/>
</p>

<p class="thirteen">
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors <strong>gave</strong>,<br/>
I am the dream and the hope of the <strong>slave.</strong><br/>

<p class="fourteen">
I rise</br>
I rise</br>
I rise.</br>
