<p> Join the first TRASH CONFERENCE to take place in the Pacific Ocean. Since people from all over the world have been ignoring the oceanâ€™s cry to recycle and produce less waste, we have formed TRASHCON. Here consumers and producers will compete to collect the most waste from the Great Pacific garbage patch. In order to qualify participants must remove a minimum of 200 pounds of waste and recyclables from the Patch. The conference will take place rain or shine.
