<h1> 
Still I Rise<br/>
Maya Angelou
</h1>

<p class="oops">
You may write me down in history<br/>
With your bitter, twisted lies,<br/>
You may tread me in the very dirt<br/>
But still, like dust, I'll <strong>rise</strong>.<br/>
</p>

<p class="one">
Does my sassiness upset you?<br/>
Why are you beset with gloom?<br/>
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br/>
Pumping in my living room.<br/>
</p>

<p class="two">
Just like moons and like suns,<br/>
With the certainty of tides,<br/>
Just like hopes springing high,<br/>
Still I'll <strong>rise</strong>.<br/>
</p>

<p class="three">
Did you want to see me broken?<br/> 
Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br/> 
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br/>
Weakened by my soulful cries.<br/>
</p>

<p class="four">
Does my haughtiness offend you?<br/> 
Don't you take it awful hard<br/>
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br/>
Diggin' in my own back yard.<br/>
</p>

<p class="five">
You may shoot me with your words,<br/>
You may cut me with your eyes,<br/>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br/>
But still, like air, I'll <strong>rise</strong>.<br/>
</p>

<p class="six">
Does my sexiness upset you?<br/> 
Does it come as a surprise<br/>
That I dance like I've got diamonds<br/>
At the meeting of my thighs?<br/> 
</p>

<p class="seven"
Out of the huts of history's shame<br/>
I <strong>rise</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="eight">
Up from a past that's rooted in pain<br/>
I <strong>rise</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="nine">
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br/>
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br/>
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br/>
</p>

<p class="ten">
I <strong>rise</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="eleven">
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear<br/>
</p>

<p class="twelve">
I <strong>rise</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="thirteen">
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br/>
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br/>

<p class="fourteen">
I <strong>rise</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="fifteen">
I <strong>rise</strong><br/>
</p>

<p class="sixteen">
I <strong>rise</strong>. <br/>
